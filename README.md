This project is an interactive command-line portfolio that showcases the skills, experience, and projects of Maher Shahin, a digital alchemist and master of the arcane arts. With a focus on creating marvels in the digital realm, Maher invites you on an epic journey through his realm of digital creation.

## Getting Started
To use this CLI portfolio, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be presented with a terminal-like interface where you can enter commands and explore Maher's skills, experience, and projects.

## Features

The CLI portfolio uses a UNIX-like command structure for navigation. You can use the following commands to explore the directory structure:

- cd [directory] - Change the current directory
- ls - List files and directories in the current directory
- pwd - Print the current directory
- download [file] - Download a specific file (e.g., CV, cover letter)

In addition to the standard commands, there is a cv module that allows you to access Maher's CV information. You can use the following flags with the cv command:

- --help or -h - Show help message
- --about or -a - Display a brief bio or introduction

- --education or -d - List academic background
- --skills or -s - Present technical skills

## Keyboard Interrupt (to be implemented - buggy right now and doesn't work :(!)
The CLI portfolio also features a keyboard interrupt that allows you to stop the output and input a new command at any time. Simply press Ctrl-C to trigger the interrupt and input a new command.
